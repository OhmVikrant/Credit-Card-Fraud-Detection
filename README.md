# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project, we shall build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms:

1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

2. Isolation Forest Algorithm


Furthermore, we shall use metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores.

In addition, we shall explore parameter histograms and correlation matrices.
